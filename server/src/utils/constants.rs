pub static SAMPLE_PROMPT:&'static str = "A hyper-detailed, painterly portrait of an anthropomorphic white cat standing upright, with soft fur rendered in fine, realistic brushstrokes. Its luminous yellow-green eyes are large and expressive, reflecting ambient light with subtle catch highlights. The cat wears an elaborate, mid-length cloak with finely embroidered floral patterns—wildflowers, vines, and gold-thread filigree—that flow naturally around the fabric folds. The fabric texture is tactile, slightly weathered linen layered over silk, with subtle fringe and hand-sewn imperfections. Rich sky-blue and ochre accents line the collar and edges, knotted at the neck with a small ornate clasp. The cat gently holds a sleek, matte-black handheld video game console—contrasting yet harmonizing with the surrounding natural motif. The device glows faintly, its screen casting a cool modern light across the paws. The cat is seen from a low angle, looking down at the device with a curious and slightly mischievous expression, as if it has just discovered a hidden level. The background is a deep velvet blue, softly gradiented with painterly clouding and blurred wildflower stalks rising into shadow. The lighting is diffuse and natural, like early evening after rain—subtle volumetric softness, no hard shadows. The scene is framed like a formal oil portrait, with a shallow depth of field and atmospheric occlusion around the edges. The style is reminiscent of Studio Ghibli meets classical European storybook illustration, with a touch of surreal whimsy. The overall effect is enchanting, gentle, and slightly uncanny—a quiet tension between timeless forest nobility and portable technology. The scene is set in a serene, mystical forest clearing, with the faint sound of a distant waterfall and the soft rustling of leaves, evoking a sense of tranquility and wonder.";
